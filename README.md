* Matt's story: why he loves asm and how he started with Compiler Explorer.
* ASM 101, it's really not that hard to read some of the basic code. It might help you to understand your code better.
* Examples of how compilers might be smart. Math stuff mostly, but intresting to see how it's usually best to rely on the code generation.
* Tech stack behind Compiler Explorer
